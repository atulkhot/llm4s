## Overview

LLM4S provides a simple, robust, and scalable framework for building LLM applications in Scala. While most LLM work is done in Python, we believe that Scala offers a fundamentally better foundation for building reliable, maintainable AI-powered applications.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress project and is likely to change significantly over time.

## Why Scala for LLMs?

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Functional Programming**: Immutable data structures and pure functions for more predictable code
- **JVM Ecosystem**: Access to a vast array of libraries and tools
- **Concurrency**: Better handling of concurrent operations with Scala's actor model
- **Performance**: JVM performance with functional programming elegance

## Features

- **Containerized Workspace**: Secure execution environment for LLM-driven operations
- **Workspace Agent Interface**: Standardized protocol for file operations and command execution
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Planned support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Project Structure

- **llm4s**: Main project - contains the core LLM4S framework
- **shared**: Shared code between main project and workspace runner
- **workspaceRunner**: Code that performs the requested actions on the workspace within the docker container
- **samples**: Usage examples demonstrating various features

## Getting Started

To get started with the LLM4S project, check out this teaser talk presented by **Kannupriya Kalra** at the Bay Area Scala Conference. This recording is essential for understanding where we’re headed:

🎥 **Teaser Talk:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXybj2P3_DE&ab_channel=SalarRahmanian

### Prerequisites

- JDK 21+
- SBT
- Docker (for containerized workspace)

### Building the Project

```bash
# For the default Scala version (3.3.3)
sbt compile

# For all supported Scala versions (2.13 and 3.3)
sbt +compile

# Build and test all versions
sbt buildAll
```

### Setup your LLM Environment

You will need an API key for either OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/) or Anthropic (https://console.anthropic.com/)
other LLMS may be supported in the future (see the backlog.

Set the environment variables:

```
LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```
or Anthropic:
```
LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_anthropic_api_key>
```

Thia will allow you to run the non-containerized examples.


### Running the Examples

```bash
# Using Scala 3.3.3
sbt "samples/runMain org.llm4s.samples.basic.BasicLLMCallingExample"
```

### Run containerised test

```bash
sbt docker:publishLocal
sbt "samples/runMain org.llm4s.samples.workspace.ContainerisedWorkspaceDemo"

# Using Scala 2.13
sbt ++2.13.14 "samples/runMain org.llm4s.samples.basic.BasicLLMCallingExample"
```

### Cross Compilation

LLM4S supports both Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.3. The codebase is set up to handle version-specific code through source directories:

- `src/main/scala` - Common code for both Scala 2.13 and 3.3
- `src/main/scala-2.13` - Scala 2.13 specific code
- `src/main/scala-3` - Scala 3 specific code

When you need to use version-specific features, place the code in the appropriate directory.

We've added convenient aliases for cross-compilation:

```bash
# Compile for all Scala versions
sbt compileAll

# Test all Scala versions
sbt testAll

# Both compile and test
sbt buildAll

# Publish for all versions
sbt publishAll
```
### Cross-Compilation Testing

We use specialized test projects to verify cross-version compatibility against the published artifacts. These tests ensure that the library works correctly across different Scala versions by testing against actual published JARs rather than local target directories.

```bash
# Run tests for both Scala 2 and 3 against published JARs
sbt testCross

# Full clean, publish, and test verification
sbt fullCrossTest
```

> **Note:** For detailed information about our cross-testing strategy and setup, see [crossTest/README.md](crossTest/README.md)

## Roadmap

Our goal is to implement Scala equivalents of popular Python LLM frameworks:

- [ ] Single API access to multiple LLM providers (like LiteLLM)
- [ ] A comprehensive toolchain for building LLM apps (like LangChain/LangGraph)
- [ ] An agentic framework (like PydanticAI, CrewAI)
- [ ] Tokenization utilities (port of tiktoken)
- [ ] Full ReAct loop implementation
- [ ] Simple tool calling mechanism

## Tool Calling

Tool calling is a critical integration - we aim to make it as simple as possible:

### Tool Signature Generation

Using ScalaMeta to automatically generate tool definitions from Scala methods:

```scala
/** My tool does some funky things with a & b...
 * @param a The first thing
 * @param b The second thing
 */
def myTool(a: Int, b: String): ToolResponse = {
  // Implementation
}
```

ScalaMeta extracts method parameters, types, and documentation to generate OpenAI-compatible tool definitions.

### Tool Call Mapping

Mapping LLM tool call requests to actual method invocations through:
- Code generation
- Reflection-based approaches
- ScalaMeta-based parameter mapping

### Secure Execution

Tools run in a protected Docker container environment to prevent accidental system damage or data leakage.
